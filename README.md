# shadow-pipe

## Project Overview

The shadow-pipe project aims to automate the management of abstract workloads, allowing the execution of commands in hidden repositories to handle specific tasks.

This is achieved through a strategic pipeline run on GitHub Actions.

The project is essential for handling sensitive and specific workloads that need to be executed in an automated way.

## shadow-pipe Project Features

The shadow-pipe project utilizes various features and key technologies to achieve its main goal:

- **GitHub Actions:** GitHub Actions is used to create a strategic pipeline that executes commands at scheduled times to handle specific workloads.

- **Git:** The project performs cloning operations on hidden repositories, allowing access and execution of sensitive tasks.

- **Credential Storage:** The project uses environment variables to store credentials and sensitive information, ensuring the security and controlled access to the hidden repositories and their operations.

## Requirements

For the execution of the shadow-pipe project, the following requirements must be met:

- **GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT):** Credentials to access the hidden repositories are stored as a secret on GitHub and must be correctly configured for the cloning operations.

- **Hidden Repositories Settings:** The `HIDDEN_REPO_01` and `HIDDEN_REPO_02` variables must be configured with the URLs of the hidden repositories to be accessed.

- **Hidden Work Commands:** The `HIDDEN_CMD_SETUP`, `HIDDEN_CMD_RUN`, and `HIDDEN_CMD_END` variables must be configured with the necessary commands to set up, execute, and finalize the workloads in the hidden repositories.

- **Environment Variables:** The `GH_PAT`, `GH_NAME`, and `GH_EMAIL` variables must be configured with the necessary information for the execution of the operations in the repository.

## Usage

The shadow-pipe project is automatically triggered through GitHub Actions, based on a scheduled execution. 

After proper configuration of the environment variables and credentials, the pipeline is initiated at the scheduled times, executing the operations defined in the hidden work commands.

## shadow-pipe Project Structure

The project consists of a YAML configuration file (.github/workflows/shadow-pipe.yml) that defines the strategic pipeline to be run on GitHub Actions. 

This file contains the necessary steps to clone the hidden repositories, configure the workloads, and execute the specific commands.

The configuration file is structured as follows:

- **name:** Defines the name of the strategic pipeline.

- **on:** Sets the trigger for the pipeline execution, which in this case is scheduled through a cron schedule.

- **jobs:** Defines the set of tasks to be executed in the pipeline, including cloning of the repositories, configuration, and execution of the hidden workloads.

Each job step is detailed, including cloning the repositories, configuring the workloads, and executing the specific commands. In addition, environment variables, stored as secrets, are used to ensure controlled and secure access to the repositories and their operations.

This structure allows for the automated execution of sensitive operations, which are vital to the project's functioning, ensuring the security and reliability of the operations.
